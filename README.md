Then, download git from here: //git-scm.com/downloads
Make a github account: https: //github.com/join
Click on "official document" and fill in all the required information

Click file > New and create a new file (for example HTML file > HTML 5)
After you make the needed changes to your file click VCS > import into version control > create Git repository
Click OK then commit the changes to git.
In order to add your project to Github, click VCS > import into version control > share project on Github

If changes are to be made, go to Webstorm and add in changes then click on VCS > Git > Commit, add your commit comment and then commit

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list
-**Branch**: it is a parallel version of a repository, it is a place where you can freely make changes without affecting the primary or main **branch** /the "live" version.

-**Clone**: A repository copy that lives on your computer, not on the website's server. Changes are made locally instead on Git.

-**Commit**: This is a "revision", a change to a file.

-**Fetch**: Allows one to make changes from remote repository a local **branch** before commiting it.

-GIT: Tracks changes in text files, and is open source.

-**Github**: GitHub is a cloud-based platform where one can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

-**Merge**: Takes the changes from one branch and applies them to another.

-**Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts occur when two seperate individuals make changes at once, to the same code, or line, in the same file. This can also occur when an individual deletes the file that one made an edit on.

**Push**: When committed changes are sent to the remote repository on github, this is a push.

-**Pull**: When changes are fetched and are merged this is a pull

-**Remote**:A server's repository, such as GitHub.com.

-**Repository**:Project files are stored, and the history of the project's revisions are stored here as well.
