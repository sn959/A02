Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list
-Branch: it is a parallel version of a repository, it is a place where you can freely make changes without affecting the primary or main branch /the "live" version.

-Clone:it is a copy of the repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server. Basically you clone in order to make changes locally on your preferred editor and the use of Git.

-Commit:A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

-Fetch:with git fetch, you can add changes from remote repository to local working branch without commiting them. Its a way to review your changes before commiting them.

-GIT: open source program to track changes in text files.

-Github:

-Merge:Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

-Merge Conflict:Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

Push:it means sending your committed changes to the remote repository on github.

-Pull:Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

-Remote:This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.

-Repository:a project's folder, contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history.
